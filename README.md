# YWA
This Python script automates the process of opening a daily yoga video from Adriene's Youtube playlist using the Google API, PyAutoGUI, and subprocess modules.

Add your own API key JSON location and it should work.

The script uses modules like webbrowser, google-auth, google-auth-oauthlib, google-auth-httplib2, google-api-python-client, pyautogui, time, and subprocess. Make sure these modules are installed before running the script.
